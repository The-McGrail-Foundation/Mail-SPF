System Requirements
-------------------

The following Perl version and packages are required for...

...building Mail::SPF:

  Perl 5.6
  Module-Build 0.2805
  Test-More
  Net-DNS-Resolver-Programmable 0.003
  (plus all the run-time requirements)

...running Mail::SPF:

  Perl 5.6
  version
  Error
  NetAddr-IP 4
  Net-DNS 0.62
  URI 1.13

Building and Installing
-----------------------

You can build and install Mail::SPF automatically using the CPAN shell, or
manually with the following commands:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

If you want to install Mail::SPF without root privileges, then the hard-coded
installation of the "spfd" executable to /usr/sbin poses a problem (cf.
rt.cpan.org #34768).  This path had to be hard-coded because Perl's built-in
Config.pm does not specify an "sbin" path that Module::Build could use as a
suitable "sbin" install path.

You can, however, work around this limitation by using the "--install_path"
option during installation:

  ./Build install --install_path sbin=/desired/sbin/path
